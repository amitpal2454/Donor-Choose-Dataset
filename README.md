# Donor-Choose-Dataset
DonorsChoose.org is a non-profit organization that connects teachers in need of classroom resources with donors who want to help. The dataset consists of information about project proposals posted by teachers on the DonorsChoose.org platform. It includes details such as teacher attributes, school information, project resources requested, project descriptions, and whether the project was funded or not.

The DonorsChoose.org dataset is often used for various machine learning tasks, such as classification and natural language processing. Researchers and data scientists utilize this dataset to develop models that can predict the likelihood of a project being funded, understand the factors influencing project success, and identify trends in educational resource needs across different regions or school types. This dataset has been a valuable resource for studying the dynamics of crowdfunding and philanthropy in the context of education.
 HERE I have used various Machine learning algorithm for classification.
